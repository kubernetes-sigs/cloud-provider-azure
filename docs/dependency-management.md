# Dependency management
We use [glide](https://github.com/Masterminds/glide) to manage package dependency, which can automate vendor dependency management and also support various kind of vendoring tools.

- [glide](https://github.com/Masterminds/glide) (tested version: 0.12.3)
- [glide-vc](https://github.com/sgotti/glide-vc) (tested version: 0.1.0)

Note that due to some limitations (see [Working with staging packages](#working-with-staging-packages)), 'glide update' && 'glide install' would fail due to unknown dependency. We've provided a wrapper script to get this around, which could be triggered via `make update`.

The goal for `Dependency management` is:
- Automatic dependency update
  Dependency update should be easy, and verifiable (see [Verify dependency](#verify-dependency))

- Minimal user interference
  User only need to care about packages the project directly depends on

## Update existing dependencies
To update existing dependencies, just edit versions in `glide.yaml` and then run `make update`

## Introduce new dependencies
Check glide.lock or vendor first, if it is already there, you can start using it.

If it is not there, or you want to depend on specific version explicitly, then first add it in glide.yaml.
```
- package: github.com/a/b
  version: {version}
```

Then add the package used in source code, but referenced by '_'.
```
_ "github.com/a/b/package"
```

Then run `make update`, this will pull in the dependency correctly. It is suggested make this step a single commit when sending pull request.

## Verify dependency
To verify dependency is in correct state, run the following test:

```
make test-update
```

## Working with staging packages
There are some packages under `staging` directory of Kubernetes repository, to which we will refer as `k8s staging packages`.

Those packages are intended to be periodically published under top-level `k8s.io` repositories, and the code under `staging` directory serves as authoritative (see description [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/staging) ).

One possible way is to specify all the versions of referenced packages explicitly in `glide.yaml`, but it's hard to maintain since user would have to edit all the versions whenever there is a version update. Also, it is not possible to sync to latest Kubernetes master versions, since some dependencies package might not have been published.

In Kubernetes code, those packages can be refereed via `k8s.io/package` directly, that is because in Kubernetes repository there are corresponding soft links under vendor directory pointing to those under staging. This is a workaround by Kubernetes  (see also discussion [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/24202)).

Such workaround makes things a bit tricky for packages that will depend on Kubernetes. The code in this repository depends on a part of Kubernetes (various controller logic), and thus indirectly depends on the `k8s staging packages`, such as `k8s.io/api`. There is no explicit mapping between main Kubernetes repository version and those `k8s staging packages`' version. Which makes it difficult to find proper version of `k8s staging packages`

For example, a vendoring tool such as glide will try to fetch `k8s.io/api` during resolving packages. But it doesn't know the exact version tag to get(not recorded in `Godeps.json`), and then it will try to use HEAD version, which is not likely to be correct.

Hereby we create a script (`hack/update-dependencies.sh`) to update dependencies. It uses `glide`'s `mirror` feature, copying staging package to a local and set it as upstream for `k8s staging packages`.

Command `make update` will trigger the update script run.

Currently there's a known issue that if you run `make update` from a stable branch, it will still trigger `glide.lock` to be modified. That's because some 'k8s.io/*' packages are synced from local git repository, which has an unstable git commit version.

We welcome new proposals if you find better ways to address this issue.
