# Cloud provider config

This doc describes cloud provider config file, which is to be used via `--cloud-config` flag of azure-cloud-controller-manager.

Here is a config file sample:

```json
{
    "cloud":"AzurePublicCloud",
    "tenantId": "0000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
    "aadClientId": "0000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
    "aadClientSecret": "0000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
    "subscriptionId": "0000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
    "resourceGroup": "<name>",
    "location": "eastus",
    "subnetName": "<name>",
    "securityGroupName": "<name>",
    "vnetName": "<name>",
    "vnetResourceGroup": "",
    "routeTableName": "<name>",
    "primaryAvailabilitySetName": "<name>",
    "cloudProviderBackoff": false,
    "useManagedIdentityExtension": false,
    "useInstanceMetadata": true
}
```

Note: All values are of string type if not explicitly called out.

## Auth configs

|Name|Description|Remark|
|---|---|---|
|cloud|The cloud environment identifier|Valid values could be found  [here](https://github.com/Azure/go-autorest/blob/v9.9.0/autorest/azure/environments.go#L29). Default to `AzurePublicCloud`.|
|tenantID|The AAD Tenant ID for the Subscription that the cluster is deployed in|**Required**.|
|aadClientID|The ClientID for an AAD application with RBAC access to talk to Azure RM APIs|Used for service principal authn.|
|aadClientSecret|The ClientSecret for an AAD application with RBAC access to talk to Azure RM APIs|Used for service principal  authn.|
|aadClientCertPath|The path of a client certificate for an AAD application with RBAC access to talk to Azure RM APIs|Used for client cert authn.|
|aadClientCertPassword|The password of the client certificate for an AAD application with RBAC access to talk to Azure RM APIs|Used for client cert authn.|
|useManagedIdentityExtension|Use managed service identity for the virtual machine to access Azure ARM APIs|Boolean type, default to false.|
|userAssignedIdentityID|The Client ID of the user assigned MSI which is assigned to the underlying VMs|Required for user-assigned managed identity.|
|subscriptionId|The ID of the Azure Subscription that the cluster is deployed in|**Required**.|

Note: Cloud provider currently supports three authentication methods, you can choose one combination of them:

- [Managed Identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-service-identity/overview):
  - For system-assigned managed identity: set `useManagedIdentityExtension` to true
  - For user-assigned managed identity: set `useManagedIdentityExtension` to true and also set `userAssignedIdentityID`
- [Service Principal](https://github.com/Azure/aks-engine/blob/master/docs/topics/service-principals.md): set `aadClientID` and `aadClientSecret`
- [Client Certificate](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-protocols-oauth-service-to-service): set `aadClientCertPath` and `aadClientCertPassword`

If more than one value is set, the order is `Managed Identity` > `Service Principal` > `Client Certificate`.

|maximumLoadBalancerRuleCount|Maximum allowed LoadBalancer Rule Count is the limit enforced by Azure Load balancer|Integer value, default to [148](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/v1.10.0/pkg/cloudprovider/providers/azure/azure.go#L48)|

### primaryAvailabilitySetName

If this is set, the Azure cloudprovider will only add nodes from that availability set to the load
balancer backend pool. If this is not set, and multiple agent pools (availability sets) are used, then
the cloudprovider will try to add all nodes to a single backend pool which is forbidden.
In other words, if you use multiple agent pools (availability sets), you MUST set this field.

### primaryScaleSetName

If this is set, the Azure cloudprovider will only add nodes from that scale set to the load
balancer backend pool. If this is not set, and multiple agent pools (scale sets) are used, then
the cloudprovider will try to add all nodes to a single backend pool which is forbidden when using Load Balancer Basic SKU.
In other words, if you use multiple agent pools (scale sets), and `loadBalancerSku` is set to `basic` you MUST set this field.

### excludeMasterFromStandardLB

Master nodes would not add to the backends of Azure loadbalancer (ALB) if `excludeMasterFromStandardLB` is set.

By default, if nodes are labeled with `node-role.kubernetes.io/master`, they would also be excluded from ALB. If you want adding the master nodes to ALB, `excludeMasterFromStandardLB` should be set to false and label `node-role.kubernetes.io/master` should be removed if it has already been applied.
