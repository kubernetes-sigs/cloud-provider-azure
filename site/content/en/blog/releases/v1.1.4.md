# Changelog since v1.1.3

## Changes by Kind

### Feature

- Introduce a configuration option `putVMSSVMBatchSize`. If set, the sync requests will be sent concurrently in batches when putting vmss vms. ([#959](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cloud-provider-azure/pull/959), [@nilo19](https://github.com/nilo19))

### Bug or Regression

- Fix: return all LBs in the resource group in ListManagedLBs when deleting the LB, so the LB deleting will not be skipped ([#973](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cloud-provider-azure/pull/973), [@nilo19](https://github.com/nilo19))
