## Changes by Kind

### Feature

- Feat: Support migrate from NIC-based to IP-based backend pool by migration API by setting `"enableMigrateToIpBasedBackendPoolAPI": true`. By using this API, there will be no downtime during the migration. ([#4044](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cloud-provider-azure/pull/4044), [@nilo19](https://github.com/nilo19))

### Other (Cleanup or Flake)

- The deprecated beta topology labels are no longer applied by default, to maintain the legacy behaviour use `--deprecated-apply-beta-topology-labels` ([#4040](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cloud-provider-azure/pull/4040), [@k8s-infra-cherrypick-robot](https://github.com/k8s-infra-cherrypick-robot))
